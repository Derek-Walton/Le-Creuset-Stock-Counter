## Overview

This small project was developed to help the Le Creuset Portsmouth Shop __easily quantify__ and __read__ the data produced by their replenishment software. while the current replenishment software was undergoing maintanence for a few weeks.

## The Problem

The current software their shop uses to manually re-order stock, was developed in 2007, and the interface is very out-dated and not straight forward

When re-ordering new stock, it was hard to quantify / understand how many of each product was needed as the software only created a new row after every purchase.

## The Solution

Instead of having to navigate through the out-dated software, manually keeping track of each item, the team was now able to simply copy the data, then paste it into the data parser and have quantified, human readable results where you could tick off each row as you go.
